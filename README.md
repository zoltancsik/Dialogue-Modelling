**Furhat**
Hello! I would like to have a short interview with you.
I will just ask a couple of questions about movies and feel free to say the first thing which comes to mind.
Letâ€™s start with a light question.
How many movies do you watch per month on average?

**User**
7

**Furhat**
That is about 84 movies a year.
Since I have Netflix I probably watch around 2 movies a week.
What was the last movie you watched?

**User**
Oppenheimer

**Furhat**
What do you remember about it?

**User**
The story was great but the film took a bit too long

**Furhat**
Would you recommend this movie?

**User**
No

**Furhat**
Why would you not recommend it?

**User**
It's too long

**Furhat**
I'll keep that in mind, if I ever get the chance to watch it.
If you had to go for just one: What would be your favourite movie genre?

**User**
action

**Furhat**
Oh, like John Wick?
Have you seen John Wick?

**User**
no

**Furhat**
It's a movie about A guy avenging the death of his beloved dog. 
I enjoyed watching it.
It certainly is a recommendation from me.
How about Die hard? Have you seen it?

**User**
yes I have seen it

**Furhat**
I think...
i watched it in the cinema with friends when it came out.
Where did you watch it for the first time?
